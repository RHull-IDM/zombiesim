**Warning! Zombiesim is for demonstration purposes only.**

Zombiesim is an agent-based model implemented in the `Starsim <https://starsim.org>` framework. It implements a zombie simulation to demonstrate how to run a simulation, create and analyze scenarios, introduce interventions, and plot results.
